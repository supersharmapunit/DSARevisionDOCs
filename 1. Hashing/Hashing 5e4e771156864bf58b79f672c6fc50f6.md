# Hashing

- If the problem says that the number of queries is of a small range so we can use Arrays instead of hashmap to make our code faster
    - for eg-
    
    our given input array 'a' , let it be a[9] = {1,3,3,4,1,4,4,4,4} for example and demonstration purpose. Size of this array is 9.
    
    Let us create a new array 'b' , lets its size be 9 , same as that of array 'a'. Let this array be empty , let it be filled with all zeroes.
    
    b[9] = {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}
    
    Main Idea : We will store frequency of all integers from array 'a' into array 'b'.
    
    This is the main idea of Hashing , we store the information of array 'a' into array 'b'(efficiently) which helps solving the problem efficiently. :-)
    
    What is the meaning of b[3]?
    
    - It will tell us about frequency of 3 in array 'a'.
    
    What is the meaning of b[4]?
    
    - It will tell us about frequency of 4 in array 'a'.
    
    What is the meaning of b[5]?
    
    - It will tell us about frequency of 5 in array 'a'.
    
    Algorithm : We will travel the whole array , say , we encounter , a[i] , lets set , x = a[i] , then lets increment value at index 'x' in array 'b' , by doing this :
    
    ```
    x = a[i]
    b[x] = b[x] + 1
    ```
    
    After the algorithm is performed , this is how the final arrays look like :
    
    a[9] = {1,3,3,4,1,4,4,4,4}
    
    b[9] = {0,2,0,2,5,0,0,0,0}
    
    We , can now clearly see , that b[1] = 2 , b[3] = 2 , b[4] = 5
    
    It means , we have pre-calculated frequencies of all numbers in array 'a' by just running a single for loop
    				int n = 9 ; 
        int a[9] = {1,3,3,4,1,4,4,4,4};
        int b[9]={0};
        int i = 0 ; 
        while(i<n)
        {
            int x = a[i] ; 
            b[x] = b[x] + 1 ; 
            i++;
        }
        //Above for loop took O(n) time.
        //All frequencies have been calculated in advance by now.. :-) :-) 
        
        int queries[3] = {3,4,1};
        int q = 3 ; 
        int j = 0 ; 
        while(j<q)
        {
            int x = queries[j] ; 
            cout<<b[x]; //takes O(1) time..
            cout<<' ';
            j++;
        }
    
    code - 
    
    ```java
    		int n = 9 ; 
        int a[9] = {1,3,3,4,1,4,4,4,4};
        int b[9]={0};
        int i = 0 ; 
        while(i<n)
        {
            int x = a[i] ; 
            b[x] = b[x] + 1 ; 
            i++;
        }
        //Above for loop took O(n) time.
        //All frequencies have been calculated in advance by now.. :-) :-) 
        
        int queries[3] = {3,4,1};
        int q = 3 ; 
        int j = 0 ; 
        while(j<q)
        {
            int x = queries[j] ; 
            cout<<b[x]; //takes O(1) time..
            cout<<' ';
            j++;
        }
    ```
