# Sorting

- Arranging data in a particular permutation(this depends on requirement)

## Worst sorting approach

- eg - Given n integer values arrange them in increasing order. [15,-1,3,8,2,6]
    - brute force of the worst possible solution → we can generate all possible permutations i.e there will be (!n permutations) and filter out the required one. TC will be O(k*(!n)) where k is the TC to generate one permutation

## Selection Sort

- one of the most simplest algorithms
- Heap sort is extremly dependent on selection sort
- Given a situation
    1. In which array [” “,” “, “X”,” ”,Y,” “,” ”] green part is sorted in increasing order and red is arranged in some random order we need to sort.

    2. Lets say ‘X’ is the last element of the sorted area. And it is less than or equal(≤) to the minimum element of the region.
    3. Let’s say “Y” is the minimun element of the unsorted region. i.e X≤Y. So the Question we should try to solve till now is How can we expand the sorted region meanwhile decreasing the unsorted region.
    4. So we can conclude the fact that X is the largest element of the sorted area && the element  Y which is coming from the unsorted area is either bigger than X or equal to X (X≤Y this was the condition). Then it is self understood then is will also be bigger than the elements before X. eg →

        So we can arrange or put Y just after X i.e we will swap 19 with 7 so our sorted will be expanded and unsorted region will shrink. And now X == 7. And we will repeat this process until X == arr.length-1.
        
    5. In the beginning of the algorithm the whole array will be the unsorted region and we will have to consider sorted region as -Infinity ( we will keep sorted region’s end pointer as -1)

        And after the first iteration we will get the sorted region as someting in the array. So the array will look like this after 1st iteration

    ### Algorithm:
    
    In every iteration: 
    
    1. We will get the index of the minimum element from the unsorted region
    
        
        ```java
        // This fn will return the idx of min. ele from arr in range [start, n-1]
        public static int getMinimumIndex(int[] arr, int start) {
        	int minIdx = start; // initially we assume that the stating idx is the min value
        	for(int i = start+1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        				// we go in the remaining array from [start+1, n-1]
        			if(arr[i] < arr[minIdx]) {
        					// compare if curr ele is better than the last found min ele
        					minIdx = i;
        			}
        	}
        	return minIdx;
        }
        ```
        
    2. Put the min ele obtained from the unsorted region into the last of sorted region.
        
        ```java
        public static void selectionSort(int[] arr) {
        	for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        		// i here denotes the unsorted region
        			int minIdx = getMinimumIndex(arr, i);
        			if(i != minIdx) swap(arr, i, minIdx);
        	}
        }
        ```
